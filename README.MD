**AutoTorch** is a simple yet effective Minecraft mod that ensures youâ€™ll never be left in the dark again!

---

#### **Features**:
- **Automatic Torch Placement**: When your surroundings get too dark (based on a configurable light level), the mod will automatically place a torch to illuminate the area.
- **Customizable Configurations**:
    - Set the minimum light level at which torches are placed.
    - Add support for custom torches from mods (e.g., soul torches, modded torches, etc.) by editing the config file.
- **Toggle On/Off**: Enable or disable the auto-placing functionality with a convenient keybind (default: `Y`).

---

#### **Perfect For**:
- Cave explorers who want to focus on mining instead of lighting.
- Builders working in dark areas.
- Players who use modpacks with additional torches and want them to work seamlessly.

---

#### **Custom LightBlock Support**:
With the configuration file, you can easily add your favorite modded torches or another light block, making it compatible with most modpacks.

Stay safe, stay bright, and let **AutoTorch** handle the lighting for you!
